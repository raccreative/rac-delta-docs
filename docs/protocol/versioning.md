# Versioning

Incremental versioning is not yet part of the protocol, but can be easily implemented in the future, as will be as easy as saving multiple rd-index.json for each version, example: rd-index-0.3.json could be compared to rd-index-0.5.json.

The SDKs also implement a method for index merging that will be used in the future for this case.

Compression is a feature that is also not part of the protocol, that is user choice.
