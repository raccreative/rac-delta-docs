# Client

In order to use the rac-delta SDK, you will need to create a RacDeltaClient, the main entry point of the SDK and where all the rac-delta operations are invoked.

    const racDeltaClient = new RacDeltaClient({

:::tip[Recommended chunk size]

The recommended chunk size for rac-delta is 1MB, but you can use the size that adjust better for you.

:::

The **RacDeltaClient** requires those fields to work properly:

- **chunk size**: The size in bytes of the chunks files will be divided for all operations of rac-delta. It is important to maintain consistent chunk size as different sizes will result on different indexes.
- **max concurrency**: The max concurrent operations that will run the rac-delta client, this applies to concurrent uploading, downloading, deletions, index generation, hashing, reconstructing...
- **storage**: The concrete storage config of the selected type, the types available are **s3**, **azure**, **gcs**, **ssh**, **local**, **url** and **http**

The selected storage type will automatically create a storage adapter with the given credentials and use it as backend for all operations of that client.

Now you will be able to use the racDeltaClient to access services or pipelines.

See [configuration](/docs/core/configuration) for full client configuration.
